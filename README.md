#### A [KvarQ] testsuite for MTBC SNP barcodes

Please see the [KvarQ documentation], especially the [tutorial section] for
more information

All data is taken from:

> "A robust SNP barcode for typing Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex strains"
> -- Coll et al (2014) doi: 10.1038/ncomms5812

The file `coll14.tsv` contains the SNPs described in the paper above.
The script `_summarize.py` generates an overview table from scan
results, including average coverage of every SNP, and a grid-like
listing of which SNPs occured in which genomes as derived, ancestral,
and mixed.
